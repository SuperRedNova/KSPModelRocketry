# KSPModelRocketry
Scaled up model rocket parts for KSP with variable textures.

Version 0.1.2

For KSP Version .90 (Might work with other versions as well, Untested)

Some Kerbal Engineers decided it would be a good Idea to upscale model rocket parts to save money.

***Alpha build, needs balancing***
